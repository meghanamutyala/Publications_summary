This project enables users to fetch and analyze academic publications from Google Scholar and DBLP. It provides functionality to retrieve publication data based on a professor's name, filter results by a specified year range, and export the filtered data to Excel or Word formats. The solution utilizes Google Colab for running the code, combining data from different sources, and handling various data processing tasks. Users can seamlessly integrate these steps into their workflow to manage and analyze academic publications efficiently.
